# Bayesian-Learning-Machine

This program performs a Naive Bayesian learning on a set of binary values

when given a train.dat file full of the the binary values where each column is a specific variable and the last column is the correct prediction, 
the machine trains itself on what it should expect the correct values should be and whether or not it should predict 1 or 0 based on the current row in the table.
